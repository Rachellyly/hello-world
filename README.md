# hello-world

Bravo!

   This is the first time that I've ever used GitHub.I'm very exited.But I also have a little upset.Because its a ten minute reading tutoral,I didn't finish reading it for two hours.So in the future,I think I should learn more in English.
   It means a lot to me to use GitHub.
   Well,bye.
